*UPytest* is a tool I developed for Python programmers that reads the userâ€™s program and provides a set of autogenerated test cases using an SMT solver. It also generates an AST graph that showcases each line of code as nodes and their inter-dependencies, helping users understand the structure and flow of their function in a given program. Additionally, my tool determines the test coverage (C0, C1) to analyse coverage(implemented this by code instrumentation) and help users identify the most suitable coverage criteria for their program. 

**Purpose of C0 (Statement Coverage)**
* Identifying dead code (code that is never executed)
* Ensuring that all parts of the program are tested
* Measuring the comprehensiveness of test suites

**Purpose of C1 (Branch Coverage)**
* Ensuring all possible paths through the code are tested
* Identifying unused or unreachable code branches
* Measuring the thoroughness of test suites in terms of decision coverage

**How UPytest Helps**

UPytest eliminates the need for manual test case writing, which significantly reduces the time and effort required in traditional unit testing approaches. The use of UPytest enables development teams to:
* Achieve higher code quality on a per-module basis
* Improve test coverage (including C0 and C1 coverage)
* Enhance the reliability of their applications
